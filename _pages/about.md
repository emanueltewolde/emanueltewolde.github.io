<!-- Welcome to my academic website! It is work in progress, especially starting from the section "Working Papers". -->

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate enough to be advised by <a href=" https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/ " target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none">Vincent Conitzer</a>. My work is supported in part by the Cooperative AI PhD Fellowship.
<!-- and to be part of the <a href=" https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/ " target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none">Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab (FOCAL)</a>. -->

I strive to understand how to enable artificial intelligence and humans to effectively achieve better (social) outcomes in strategic interactions with other agents. More specifically, my current research interests lie in algorithmic game theory, LLM agents, and reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on the safety, coordination, cooperation, and alignment of AI systems. Further research topics I enjoy are mathematical optimization, learning in games, computational complexity, and social choice theory.

Currently, I am working at Meta's research unit FAIR (within Meta Superintelligence Labs) on LLM coding agents for AI research. Prior to CMU, I completed a master's and bachelor's degree in mathematics at Imperial College London and the Technical University Darmstadt respectively. In addition to that, I have also worked with the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (IEE) on machine learning methods for smarter renewable energy systems.
