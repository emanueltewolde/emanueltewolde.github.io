Hi!

I am Emanuel Tewolde and a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Vincent Conitzer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/) and to be part of the [Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/). 
During my PhD, I strive to understand how we can enable artificial intelligence (and humans) to effectively achieve better outcomes in strategic interactions with other agents, with a particular interest in better **social** outcomes. My research will mostly focus on algorithmic game theory and (multi-agent) reinforcement learning. 

Prior to CMU, I completed a master's and bachelor's degree in mathematics at Imperial College London and the Technical University Darmstadt respectively. During that time, I have also worked with the [Fraunhofer IEE](https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/en.html) on machine learning methods for smarter renewable energy systems.
