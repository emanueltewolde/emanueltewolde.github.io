Hi!

I am Emanuel Tewolde and a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Vincent Conitzer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/) and to be part of the [Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab (FOCAL)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/). 

I strive to understand how to enable artificial intelligence and humans to effectively achieve better (social) outcomes in strategic interactions with other agents. My research interests will mostly lie in algorithmic game theory and (multi-agent) reinforcement learning. 

Prior to CMU, I completed a master's and bachelor's degree in mathematics at Imperial College London and the Technical University Darmstadt respectively. During that time, I have also worked with the [Fraunhofer IEE](https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/en.html) on machine learning methods for smarter renewable energy systems.
