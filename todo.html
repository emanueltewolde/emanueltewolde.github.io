To go through next:

- Highlight representative papers

- Add the two aamas submissions, and the stoc submission

- make it so that if you find my website through google, it shows my image on the side of the google link

- add blog post link

- add links to aaai papers (proceedings links)

- add a service tab such as conference reviewing 


General Info to Remember:

- To build locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -l` in the terminal, and open http://localhost:4000/ in browser

- I removed the navigation header from the file by commenting out everything from the file masthead.html

- The way a paper display can be changed is on includes/archive-single.html

- I decided against adding images, but one of those can be added by adding an 'image' field to your desired post
