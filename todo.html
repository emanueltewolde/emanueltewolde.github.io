To go through next:

- add a list of news above publications list. Add a page for it, and with claude, figure out how to always displays, say, the top 5-10 items from it on the main page

- update EVI to oral if it is 

- add blog post link

- add links to aaai papers (proceedings links)

- add twitter link

- add a service tab such as conference reviewing 

General Info to Remember:

- To build locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -l` in the terminal, and open http://localhost:4000/ in browser

- I removed the navigation header from the file by commenting out everything from the file masthead.html

- The way a paper display can be changed is on includes/archive-single.html

- I decided against adding images, but one of those can be added by adding an 'image' field to your desired post
