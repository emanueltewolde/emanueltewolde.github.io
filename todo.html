To go through next:
- Add DBLP page to my website
- change teaching experiences
- Somehow the website doesn't update on my changes on archive-single.html. Is that even the right document to modify in order to change how my publications and working papers appear?
- remove the </p> --> from the comp compl paper and add the urls like arxiv and slides to the working papers!

To Do:

- Update url address: Once in _config.yml and once in authors>yml

- Add DBLP

- check mobile perspective on the website 

- Add teaching experience to main page

- remove the fact that clicking on a paper of the main page will open up a whole new page

- add pictures to my accepted papers

- correct all the hyerlinks



General Info to Remember:

- I removed the navigation header from the file by commenting out everything from the file masthead.html

- The way a paper display can be changed is on archive-single.html
