To go through next:

- add arxiv link to mpircomplexity paper

- add a service tab such as conference reviewing 

General Info to Remember:

- I removed the navigation header from the file by commenting out everything from the file masthead.html

- The way a paper display can be changed is on archive-single.html

- I decided against adding images, but one of those can be added by adding an 'image' field to your desired post
