To go through next:

- Add links to two aamas submissions, the stoc submission, IRPractical arxiv, and the arxiv and published link to aaai paper

- make it so that if you find my website through google, it shows my image on the side of the google link
- also the small icon to the left of the page title (and in the browser tab), called `favicon`.

- add blog post link

<!-- - add a service tab such as conference reviewing  -->


General Info to Remember:

- To build locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -l` in the terminal, and open http://localhost:4000/ in browser

- The news are in ./_data/news.yml

- I removed the navigation header from the file by commenting out everything from the file masthead.html

- The way a paper display can be changed is on includes/archive-single.html

- I decided against adding images, but one of those can be added by adding an 'image' field to your desired post
